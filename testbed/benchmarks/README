===[ Subfolders ]===

[ippc2011] 
These are the domains and instances that were used for the International
Probabilistic Planning Competition in 2011.

[ippc2011-sac]
All problems in this folder are functionally equivalent to the IPPC2011
problems, but (dynamic) state action constraints (action preconditions in RDDL2)
are added. Note that all added action preconditions are such that only actions
that are considered unreasonable by the PROST planner become inapplicable.

[ippc2011-enum] 
All problems (currently, only the instances of the elevators domain) in this
folder are functionally equivalent to the IPPC2011 problems, and are based on
the problems in the ippc2011-sac folder. These problems additionally use enums
to simplify the domain description.

[ippc2014]
These are the domains and instances that were used for the International
Probabilistic Planning Competition in 2014.
