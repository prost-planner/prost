===[ Subfolders ]===

Each subfolder corresponds to a domain in the format `domain-year` where
`domain` is the respective name and `year` is the IPPC year where it was first
introduced. A few domains were reused in different IPPC editions. In such cases,
we keep several folders if each edition used different instances. In the cases
where all instances were identical, we just keep the folder of the first IPPC
edition which introduced the domain.
